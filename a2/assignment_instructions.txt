Task:
Create a shell script that automates the download and summary generation of CSV datasets.

Requirements:
The script should be written with bash commands (including sed and awk, if needed).
When you run this script, it asks for a URL to a CSV dataset
E.g., https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/186/wine+quality.zipLinks to an external site.
Make sure your script works with any URLs for tabular datasets in the UCI Machine Learning Repository
Your script should
Unzip the CSV file(s), if zipped
Generate a summary file (summary.md) for each CSV file
The summary file (summary.md) should include
A list of all features with the index number
min/max/mean/standard deviation for numerical columns in a table format
If needed, numerical columns can be identified by user input after showing the list of features. (This can be automated.)

# Feature Summary for winequality-red.csv

## Feature Index and Names
1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity
3. citric acid
...

## Statistics (Numerical Features)
| Index | Feature           | Min  | Max  | Mean  | StdDev |
|-------|-------------------|------|------|-------|--------|
| 1     | fixed acidity     | 4.60 | 15.90 | 8.319 | 1.741  |
| 2     | volatile acidity  | 0.12 | 1.58 | 0.528 | 0.179  |
...

Clarification:
User inputs allowed are (1) the URL and (2) the column index numbers to identify numerical columns.
The rest of the processing should be fully automated.

Submission Guide:
Create an "a2" directory in your cs131 GitHub repo. (Submit git clone <your GitHub repo link> command)
Put your shell script into the directory (datacollector.sh)
Also, run your script for the winequality-red.csv and put the resulting summary.md into the directory
Write a brief explanation of your shell tool in README.md under the a2 directory (cs131/a2/README.md). This file should include sections like:
What this command does
How to use this command
Demo (Copy/Paste the actual terminal execution results)
(You can read more about README: https://www.makeareadme.com/Links to an external site.)
You are required to present your command during the class on July 2. You will show the README.md from GitHub while presenting. Format the README so it is clear.
