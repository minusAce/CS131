Objective
Learn how to build a Spark application with MLlib

Tasks
1. Create a dataset that only contains passenger_count (4th col), pulocationid (8th col), dolocationid (9th col), and total_amount (17th col) based on the 2019-04.csv dataset.
In the Jupyter notebook, show the first 10 entries in the created dataset.

2. Create trainDF and testDF.

3. Create a decision tree regressor to predict total_amount from the other three features.

4. Create a pipeline.

5. Train the model. 

6. Show the predicted results along with the three features in the notebook. (Show the first 10 entries.)

7. Evaluate the model with RMSE. (The RMSE value should be in the notebook.)

Submission Guideline
  Download the Jupyter notebook executed on a Spark cluster and push it to your GitHub Repo, cs131/a4
  Submit the link to the repo.
