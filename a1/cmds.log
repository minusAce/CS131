1. "cd ~" to get home directory. "pwd" to get the path.

2. "cd /" to get to root. Then "cd proc" and "ls" to find the information about memory and CPU under the meminfo and cpuinfo files.

3. "cd /" to get to root. Then "cd etc" and "ls" to find the operating system version under ec2_version.

4a. I used "cut -d "," -f 2,8 2019-04.csv | grep "2019-04-02" | cut -d "," -f 2 | sort | uniq -c | sort" to identify all pickup locations on April 2nd, 2019. The first command cuts all the fields except the pickup date
and the pickup location id. The second command will look through the pickup dates and only get the ones that match "2019-04-02" or April 2nd, 2019. Then it will return a list with the pickup locations that match and then
the third command will cut all the fields except the pickup location ids. They will then be sorted since in order to use uniq -c they first need to be sorted then they will be counted then sorted again so I can easily see
the top 3 results.

4b. I used "cut -d "," -f 2,8 2019-04.csv | grep "2019-04-10" | cut -d "," -f 2 | sort | uniq -c | sort" to identify all pickup locations on April 10th, 2019. The first command cuts all the fields except the pickup date
and the pickup location id. The second command will look through the pickup dates and only get the ones that match "2019-04-10" or April 10th, 2019. Then it will return a list with the pickup locations that match and then
the third command will cut all the fields except the pickup location ids. They will then be sorted since in order to use uniq -c they first need to be sorted then they will be counted then sorted again so I can easily see
