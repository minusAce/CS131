Objectives:
Learn how to use the commands cut, sort, uniq -c, grep
(Do not use the AWK command)

Submission Guide:
All of these questions should be answered while you are logged into the Google Cloud server.
DO NOT COMMIT/PUSH the original dataset. (2019-04.csv)
Make sure all files you submit are cleaned up and annotated by vim or nano so the TA can find your answer to each question easily.
Please create a new directory named "a1" under the cs131 repo, store all required files under the directory, and push it to GitHub. 
cmds.log should contain all commands used to answer the questions (annotate the file to indicate the corresponding question.)
a1.txt should contain all terminal outputs to answer the questions. (annotate the file to indicate the corresponding question.)
Submit a one-line git clone command so the grader can clone your repo.
git clone <link to your github repo>

Preparation:
To download a large dataset file from Google Drive, we will use a "gdown" commandLinks to an external site..
Since this is a third-party script, you need to install it manually.
Install "pip" by "apt install python3-pip". If permission is required, use "sudo apt install python3-pip" 
Install "gdown" by "pip install gdown".
Download the taxi dataset by "gdown 18oi_OAsRnl8YAOxtQ5smcJsL7IHl-2x0"
If the command cannot be found, you may have seen a warning like the following:
"WARNING: The script gdown is installed in '/home/<user-name>/.local/bin' which is not on PATH."
If this is the case, run
/home/<user-name>/.local/bin/gdown 18oi_OAsRnl8YAOxtQ5smcJsL7IHl-2x0

Tasks:
What is your home directory path?  How did you find out (commands used)?
Using only "ls" (and maybe "grep"), can you find out which file under directory /proc/ contains information about memory (mem) on your server? Which file contains information about the CPU's on your server?
Identify the operating system version. Which file under /etc/ contains this information?
Using the taxi dataset (2019-04.csv):
Sort the pickup location IDs in order to find the most popular pickup locations on April 2nd, 2019. Identify the top 3 locations.
Sort the pickup location IDs in order to find the most popular pickup locations on April 10th, 2019. Identify the top 3 locations.

Hints (regex):
^, $: start-of-line and end-of-line respectively.
[^a]: any character except 'a' https://chortle.ccsu.edu/finiteautomata/Section07/sect07_12.html
